Types of analysis
=================

Descriptive: merely describes the data. Doesn't predict anything. Can't be generalized.
Exploratory: find relationships you didn't know about. Not used for generalizing/predicting.
Inferential: Use small data to day something about bigger data. Depends a lot on what you're looking at.
Predictive: Use data about some objects to predict values for other objects.
Causal: What happens to one variable when you change another? Typically used in averages.
Mechanistic analysis: understand exact changes in some vars that lead to exact changes in other vars.
